## Attribution ##

This project is based on the original **[MMM-Reddit](https://github.com/mumblebaj/MMM-Reddit)** MagicMirror² module by GitHub user **[mumblebaj](https://github.com/mumblebaj)**.

The original module provided the core Reddit fetching, configuration system, and headline/image display logic. This fork expands upon that work by introducing a continuous scrolling ticker display and related configuration options, while retaining compatibility with the original design and behavior.

All credit for the foundational module belongs to the original author.

This module is used to show top level reddit info for MagicMirror² as a block for images and headlines, or as a continuous scrolling ticker.

It is highly configurable and primarily allows users to choose between three display types, the number of posts pull from reddit, how many of those posts to display, how often to cycle through the set of posts, and how frequently to refresh posts from reddit.

## End User Dependencies ##

## Config Options ##

#### Primary ####

Option  | Default | Description
------- | ------- | -------------
`subreddit`  | `'all'` | Subreddit to pull content from.<br><br>Please enter `frontpage` to get content from the frontpage.<br>This value can also be an array of subreddits. Ex: `['funny', 'jokes', 'tifu']`
`type`  | `hot` | Filter applied to searches.<br><br>**Options:** `hot`, `top`, `new`, `rising`, `controversial`
`displayType` | `headlines` | Format in which the reddit posts are displayed. See below for configurations specific to each display type.<br><br>**Options:** `headlines`, `image`, `ticker`
`count` | `10` | Number of posts to get from reddit.
`show` | `5` | Number of posts to be displayed at a time.<br><br>If this number is lower than `count`, then the posts will be rotated after a given number of seconds configured with `rotateInterval`.
`width` | `400` | Number of pixels wide the module will take up on the display.
`updateInterval` | `15` | Number of minutes until the set of current posts gets refreshed from reddit.
`rotateInterval` | `30` | Number of seconds until the posts currently being displayed is substituted by the subsequent set.
`characterLimit` | `false` | Set a character limit for post titles. Titles that are truncated will have "..." appended to the title to indicate it.
`titleReplacements` | `[]` | An array of objects used to make replacements to words or phrases in a title. Title replacements will occur prior to the character limit being enforced, so these can be used to help shorten post titles or just for fun.<br><br>**Example:** `[{toReplace: 'millennials', replacement: 'snake people', caseSensitive: false'}, {toReplace: 'politicians', replacement: 'lizard people'}]`<br><br>**Note:** `caseSensitive` defaults to true. Also accepts regular expressions for advanced find and replace, but do not include preceding and trailing forward slashes. For those not familiar with regular expressions, see [here](https://regexr.com/).
`forceImmediateUpdate` | `true` | When set to `true`, as soon as posts are received from reddit according to the updateInterval, posts are immediately rendered, regardless of what is currently on screen. When set to `false`, the module will allow the existing set to finish and the new \#1 post will be from the updated set of posts.<br><br><b>Note:</b> If this is set to `false`, it's a good idea to try to keep the show &amp; count, rotateInterval, and updateInterval in good sync with this. For example, if you're using images, displaying 1 image with a count of 10 posts rotating every 30 seconds, it will take 5 minutes to cycle through a set. Therefore, ideally you'll want to set your updateInterval to a mutiple of 5 so that it's not waiting too long to update the posts as your update will appear somewhat inconsistent.

#### Secondary ####

Option  | Default | Description
------- | ------- | -------------
`showHeader` | `true` | Show the module header.
`headerType` | `sentence` | Format in which the header is displayed.<br><br>**Options:**<br>1. Sentence (Ex: Top Posts from r/funny, r/jokes, and r/tifu)<br>2. Chained (Ex: Top Posts from r/funny+jokes+tifu)
`showAll` | `false` | Alias to show all of the below "show" toggles. `showHeader` is the only toggle excluded from this.<br><br>**Note:** If this toggle is set, it will ignore all configurations set to false.
`showRank` | `true` | Show number preceding posts indicating what order it was returned from reddit.
`showScore` | `true` | Show the total upvotes less downvotes currently attributed to a post.
`showNumComments` | `true` | Show the total number of comments on a post.
`showGilded` | `true` | Show if a post has been gilded and, if so, how many times it has been gilded.
`showAuthor` | `false` | Show the username of the person who submitted the post.
`showSubreddit` | `false` | Show the subreddit to which a post was submitted. Mostly only valuable if using the frontpage, r/all, or passing an array of subreddits.
